My project "echoes of (e)motion" starts with the visual language of sharp geometric lines then later transforms into a dots that repeats itself like an echo would.

This generative art piece is to symbolize the echoes of our actions and emotions on our environment and how it may not be immediately felt but will leave a residue in the aftermath. The beginning is represented with sharp lines to symbolize the sharpness and the obvious existence of our thoughts, and the circular shape to represents the fleeting nature of emotions, and the echoes are represented by dots lingering longer on the screen - waiting a moment before it completely disappears.

I believe this is a generative piece because the randomize aspect of the lines made by the computer, also represents the uncontrollable emotional factors in our lives, positioning themselves as almost "automated" introductions into our days. I believe that the section controlled by the computer in this piece is my "uncontrollable effects" of the concept.
